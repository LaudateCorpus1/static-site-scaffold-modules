# Vite Plugin Img

A [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) plugin to transform images in your HTML. Will turn `img` tags into wrapped `picture` tags, with with images cut into different sizes for responsive images and transformed into `avif` and `webp`. Ignores `gif` and `svg` images from transformation (`gif` to `mp4` coming soon). Works well with [`vite-plugin-imagemin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-imagemin).
